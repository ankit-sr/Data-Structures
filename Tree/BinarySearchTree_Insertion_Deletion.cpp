/*
	Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special case of binary tree which follows the rule that:
		1. ALl the nodes(data) to the left of the parent node should be less than the parent itself.
		2. All the nodes(data) to the right of the parent node should be greater than the parent node data.
		
	For example: 
				10
			      /    \
			     5	    20
			   /  \    /  \
			 2    8  15   24   
		
		Note that, each node to the left of parent is smaller and that to the right is greater than the parent node.
		
		Insertion in BST: We are follwing recursive approach to insert the data in the tree.
						We call the method again and again until we reach to the leaf node or at the correct position.
						
		Deletion in BST: While deleting a node in BST, three cases arise
		   Node to be deleted have
			1. 0 child: In this case, we delete the node and assign NULL to the parent pointing to this node.
			2. 1 child: We link the child of this node to the parent of the node and then delete it.
			3. 2 children: In this case, we find either the inorder successor or inorder predecessor of the node, copies
						the data of inorder successor in the node to be deleted, and finally deletes the inorder successor.
						
		Traversing BST: We generally follow inorder approach in BST, as it provides sorted data.
