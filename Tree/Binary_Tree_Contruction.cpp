/*
	A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node have 
	maximum of 2 nodes called left and right child of the respective node.
	
	A binary tree node contains following parts:
	1. Data
	2. Pointer to the left child node
	3. Pointer to the right child node.
	
	For example:
			10
		      /    \
		     5      20
		   /  \    /   \
		 12    8  14    7
	is a binary tree in which 5 and 20 are the left and right child of the root node 10.
	While, (12, 8), (14, 7) are the left and right child nodes of 5 and 20 respectively.
	
	Note that, 12, 8, 14, 7 are the leaf nodes and thus does not have any child.
	They contain NULL in the left and right pointers.
