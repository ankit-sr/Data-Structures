/*
    Breadth First Search Traversal is a popular traversal method in graph.
    It uses queue data structure for storing elements before output.
    The pseudo code for the traversal method is as follows:
        1. Initialize a boolean vecotr visited of size of number of vertices with false,
           which indicates whether a vertex is already visited or not.
        2. Push the source (generally 0 vertex) in the queue and set the visited[vertex] to true.
        3. Pop the front node.
            a. Print data.
            b. Find all the adjacent vertices with visited status false.
            c. Push them in the queue and set the visited status to true.
        4. Repeat step 3 until queue becomes empty.
        5. Finish and Return.
